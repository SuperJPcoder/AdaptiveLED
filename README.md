## 🔄 Circuit Design and Working
### 📶 Workflow:
**Stage 1:** Connecting LDR and LED in series → LED brightness increases with ambient light. ❌ Not our goal!  
**Stage 2:** LDR and LED connected in **parallel** → Achieves desired behavior (LED brightens when ambient light decreases).  
**Stage 3:** Multiple LDRs in parallel for better sensitivity but **no power saving**.  
**Stage 4:** Using **NPN transistor** to amplify current, enabling **energy efficiency and power saving**. ✅ Final design!  

### ⚙ Working Principle:
1️⃣ **LDR senses ambient light** and changes its resistance accordingly.
